# BINAS: A Useful Reference Book for Science Education
 
BINAS is an acronym for *Biology, Chemistry and Physics*, which are the three main subjects covered by this reference book. BINAS is designed for secondary education in the Netherlands, and can be used for the courses of natural sciences, nature, life and technology, and research and design. BINAS is also allowed for the central exams of biology, chemistry and physics for havo and vwo levels.

BINAS contains a wealth of information on various topics related to science, such as constants, units, formulas, data tables, graphs, spectra, symbols, maps and more. The book is fully in color and has a clear and organized layout. The sixth edition of BINAS was published in 2014 and updated according to the current state of science and the exam programs. The book has 100 tables divided into four sections: general, physics, chemistry and biology. The tables are numbered and color-coded according to the subject they belong to: blue for physics, red for chemistry and green for biology. Some tables are in the overlap areas of the subjects and have a small Venn diagram to indicate that.
 
BINAS is a useful tool for students and teachers who need to quickly look up facts, figures or formulas related to science. It can also help to stimulate curiosity and interest in the natural world and its phenomena. BINAS is available as a printed book or as an e-book. There is also an English edition of BINAS for havo/vwo students who follow bilingual education.

BINAS can be used in different ways depending on the purpose and the subject of study. For example, students can use BINAS to find the values of physical constants, the properties of elements, the formulas of chemical reactions, the structures of organic molecules, the names of biological taxa, the maps of the solar system and the stars, and more. Teachers can use BINAS to design experiments, assignments, quizzes and tests based on the data and information provided in the book.
 
One way to use BINAS effectively is to familiarize oneself with the layout and the numbering of the tables. Each table has a title, a number and a color code that indicate what kind of information it contains and which subject it belongs to. Some tables also have subheadings or symbols that help to organize or explain the data. For example, table 67F shows the amino acids and their symbols, properties and codons. Another way to use BINAS efficiently is to use the index at the end of the book to find the table that corresponds to a specific term or topic. For example, if one wants to find out about nuclear fusion, one can look up "fusion" in the index and see that it is related to table 25.
 
BINAS is not only a reference book for science education, but also a source of inspiration and curiosity for anyone who is interested in learning more about the natural world and its phenomena. BINAS can help to answer questions, solve problems, explore ideas, discover patterns, compare data, analyze trends, and more. BINAS is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge and understanding of science.
